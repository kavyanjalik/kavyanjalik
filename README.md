## Hello!

### 
   I am a PhD candidate (2020-2024) at the Department of Social Sciences, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, and a doctoral researcher at the Value Conflicts in a Differentiated Europe (ValCon) international research project. My research lies at the intersection of national identities, political mobilisation and social media design. I created this page to collect all the R codes I have written over the years in one page, including codes on computational social sciences methods to analyse big data from social media and survey analysis.

### Featured Projects
